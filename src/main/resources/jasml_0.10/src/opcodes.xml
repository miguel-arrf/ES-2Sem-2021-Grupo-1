The arrayref, index, and value are popped from the operand stack. The reference value is stored as the component of the array at index.
The type of value must be assignment compatible with the type of the components of the array referenced by arrayref. Assignment of a value of reference type S (source) to a variable of reference type T (target) is allowed only when the type S supports all the operations defined on type T. The detailed rules follow:
If S is a class type, then:
If T is a class type, then S must be the same class as T, or S must be a subclass of T;
If T is an interface type, S must implement interface T.
If S is an interface type, then:
If T is a class type, then T must be Object.
If T is an interface type, then T must be the same interface as S or a superinterface of S.
If S is an array type, namely, the type SC[], that is, an array of components of type SC, then:
If T is a class type, then T must be Object.
If T is an array type TC[], that is, an array of components of type TC, then one of the following must be true:
TC and SC are the same primitive type.
TC and SC are reference types, and type SC is assignable to TC by these runtime rules.
If T is an interface type, T must be one of the interfaces implemented by arrays.]]>

The result of an fadd instruction is governed by the rules of IEEE arithmetic:
If either value1 or value2 is NaN, the result is NaN.
The sum of two infinities of opposite sign is NaN.
The sum of two infinities of the same sign is the infinity of that sign.
The sum of an infinity and any finite value is equal to the infinity.
The sum of two zeroes of opposite sign is positive zero.
The sum of two zeroes of the same sign is the zero of that sign.
The sum of a zero and a nonzero finite value is equal to the nonzero value.
The sum of two nonzero finite values of the same magnitude and opposite sign is positive zero.
In the remaining cases, where neither operand is an infinity, a zero, or NaN and the values have the same sign or have different magnitudes, the sum is computed and rounded to the nearest representable value using IEEE 754 round to nearest mode. If the magnitude is too large to represent as a float, we say the operation overflows; the result is then an infinity of appropriate sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent as a float, we say the operation underflows; the result is then a zero of appropriate sign.

If the dividend is a zero and the divisor is finite, the result equals the dividend.
In the remaining cases, where neither operand is an infinity, a zero, or NaN, the floating-point remainder result from a dividend value1 and a divisor value2 is defined by the mathematical relation result = value1 - (value2 * q), where q is an integer that is negative only if value1 / value2 is negative and positive only if value1 / value2 is positive, and whose magnitude is as large as possible without exceeding the magnitude of the true mathematical quotient of value1 and value2.

            <![CDATA[A tableswitch is a variable-length instruction. Immediately after the tableswitch opcode, between 0 and 3 null bytes (zeroed bytes, not the null object) are inserted as padding. The number of null bytes is chosen so that the following byte begins at an address that is a multiple of 4 bytes from the start of the current method (the opcode of its first instruction). Immediately after the padding follow bytes constituting three signed 32-bit values: default, low, and high. Immediately following those bytes are bytes constituting a series of high - low + 1 signed 32-bit offsets. The value low must be less than or equal to high. The high - low + 1 signed 32-bit offsets are treated as a 0-based jump table. Each of these signed 32-bit values is constructed as (byte1 << 24) | (byte2 << 16) | (byte3 << 8) | byte4.
The index must be of type int and is popped from the operand stack. If index is less than low or index is greater than high, then a target address is calculated by adding default to the address of the opcode of this tableswitch instruction. Otherwise, the offset at position index - low of the jump table is extracted. The target address is calculated by adding that offset to the address of the opcode of this tableswitch instruction. Execution then continues at the target address.
The target address that can be calculated from each jump table offset, as well as the ones that can be calculated from default, must be the address of an opcode of an instruction within the method that contains this tableswitch instruction.]]>

            <![CDATA[A lookupswitch is a variable-length instruction. Immediately after the lookupswitch opcode, between zero and three null bytes (zeroed bytes, not the null object) are inserted as padding. The number of null bytes is chosen so that the defaultbyte1 begins at an address that is a multiple of four bytes from the start of the current method (the opcode of its first instruction). Immediately after the padding follow a series of signed 32-bit values: default, npairs, and then npairs pairs of signed 32-bit values. The npairs must be greater than or equal to 0. Each of the npairs pairs consists of an int match and a signed 32-bit offset. Each of these signed 32-bit values is constructed from four unsigned bytes as (byte1 << 24) | (byte2 << 16) | (byte3 << 8) | byte4.
The table match-offset pairs of the lookupswitch instruction must be sorted in increasing numerical order by match.
The key must be of type int and is popped from the operand stack. The key is compared against the match values. If it is equal to one of them, then a target address is calculated by adding the corresponding offset to the address of the opcode of this lookupswitch instruction. If the key does not match any of the match values, the target address is calculated by adding default to the address of the opcode of this lookupswitch instruction. Execution then continues at the target address.
The target address that can be calculated from the offset of each match-offset pair, as well as the one calculated from default, must be the address of an opcode of an instruction within the method that contains this lookupswitch instruction.]]>

If the field descriptor type is float, long, or double, then the value must be a float, long, or double, respectively. If the field descriptor type is a reference type, then the value must be of a type that is assignment compatible with the field descriptor type. If the field is final, it should be declared in the current class. Otherwise, an IllegalAccessError is thrown.
The value and objectref are popped from the operand stack. The objectref must be of type reference. The value undergoes value set conversion, resulting in value, and the referenced field in objectref is set to value.]]>

The runtime constant pool item at that index must be a symbolic reference to a method, which gives the name and descriptor of the method as well as a symbolic reference to the class in which the method is to be found. The named method is resolved. The method must not be an instance initialization method or the class or interface initialization method. Finally, if the resolved method is protected, and it is either a member of the current class or a member of a superclass of the current class, then the class of objectref must be either the current class or a subclass of the current class.
Let C be the class of objectref. The actual method to be invoked is selected by the following lookup procedure:
If C contains a declaration for an instance method with the same name and descriptor as the resolved method, and the resolved method is accessible from C, then this is the method to be invoked, and the lookup procedure terminates.
Otherwise, if C has a superclass, this same lookup procedure is performed recursively using the direct superclass of C ; the method to be invoked is the result of the recursive invocation of this lookup procedure.
Otherwise, an AbstractMethodError is raised.
The objectref must be followed on the operand stack by nargs argument values, where the number, type, and order of the values must be consistent with the descriptor of the selected instance method.
If the method is synchronized, the monitor associated with objectref is acquired or reentered.
If the method is not native, the nargs argument values and objectref are popped from the operand stack. A new frame is created on the Java virtual machine stack for the method being invoked. The objectref and the argument values are consecutively made the values of local variables of the new frame, with objectref in local variable 0, arg1 in local variable 1 (or, if arg1 is of type long or double, in local variables 1 and 2), and so on. Any argument value that is of a floating-point type undergoes value set conversion prior to being stored in a local variable. The new frame is then made current, and the Java virtual machine pc is set to the opcode of the first instruction of the method to be invoked. Execution continues with the first instruction of the method.
If the method is native and the platform-dependent code that implements it has not yet been bound into the Java virtual machine, that is done. The nargs argument values and objectref are popped from the operand stack and are passed as parameters to the code that implements the method. Any argument value that is of a floating-point type undergoes value set conversion prior to being passed as a parameter. The parameters are passed and the code is invoked in an implementation-dependent manner. When the platform-dependent code returns, the following take place:
If the native method is synchronized, the monitor associated with objectref is released or exited as if by execution of a monitorexit instruction.
If the native method returns a value, the return value of the platform-dependent code is converted in an implementation-dependent way to the return type of the native method and pushed onto the operand stack.]]>

            <![CDATA[For detailed information about threads and monitors in the Java virtual machine, see Chapter 8 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification, "Threads and Locks."
A monitorenter instruction may be used with one or more monitorexit instructions to implement a synchronized statement in the Java programming language. The monitorenter and monitorexit instructions are not used in the implementation of synchronized methods, although they can be used to provide equivalent locking semantics; however, monitor entry on invocation of a synchronized method is handled implicitly by the Java virtual machines method invocation instructions. See Section 7.14 of Java Virtual Machine Specification for more information on the use of the monitorenter and monitorexit instructions.
The association of a monitor with an object may be managed in various ways that are beyond the scope of this specification. For instance, the monitor may be allocated and deallocated at the same time as the object. Alternatively, it may be dynamically allocated at the time when a thread attempts to gain exclusive access to the object and freed at some later time when no thread remains in the monitor for the object.
The synchronization constructs of the Java programming language require support for operations on monitors besides entry and exit. These include waiting on a monitor (Object.wait) and notifying other threads waiting on a monitor (Object.notifyAll and Object.notify). These operations are supported in the standard package java.lang supplied with the Java virtual machine. No explicit support for these operations appears in the instruction set of the Java virtual machine.]]>

The first form of the wide instruction modifies one of the instructions iload, fload, aload, lload, dload, istore, fstore, astore, lstore, dstore, or ret. The second form applies only to the iinc instruction.
In either case, the wide opcode itself is followed in the compiled code by the opcode of the instruction wide modifies. In either form, two unsigned bytes indexbyte1 and indexbyte2 follow the modified opcode and are assembled into a 16-bit unsigned index to a local variable in the current frame, where the value of the index is
(indexbyte1 << 8) | indexbyte2. The calculated index must be an index into the local variable array of the current frame. Where the wide instruction modifies an lload, dload, lstore, or dstore instruction, the index following the calculated index (index + 1) must also be an index into the local variable array. In the second form, two immediate unsigned bytes constbyte1 and constbyte2 follow indexbyte1 and indexbyte2 in the code stream. Those bytes are also assembled into a signed 16-bit constant, where the constant is (constbyte1 << 8) | constbyte2.
The widened bytecode operates as normal, except for the use of the wider index and, in the case of the second form, the larger increment range.]]>

Otherwise, execution proceeds at the address of the instruction following this ifnonnull instruction.]]>

            <![CDATA[The jsr_w instruction is used with the ret instruction in the implementation of the finally clauses of the Java programming language. Note that jsr_w pushes the address onto the operand stack and ret gets it out of a local variable. This asymmetry is intentional.
Although the jsr_w instruction takes a 4-byte branch offset, other factors limit the size of a method to 65535 bytes. This limit may be raised in a future release of the Java virtual machine.]]>
